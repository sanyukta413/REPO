Both reference and dereference operators are necessary tools in pointers. 

Reference Operator/Address at: '&' denotes reference operator. It is a unary operator hence, only one operand is needed. In reference operator, the required operand is a "variable". This operator returns the address of the given associated variable. 

For eg: Let us consider a memory 'A' with value assigned A=10 and the address of the memory 'A' be 100. Now, '&A' gives the output->100 because '100' is the memory address of 'A'. 

Dereference Operator/Value contains: '*' denotes dereference operator. It is a unary operator hence, only one operand is needed. In dereference operator, the required operand is a "memory address". This operator returns the value of the given associated memory address.

For eg: Let us consider a memory 'A' with value assigned A=10 and the address of the memory 'A' be 100. Now, we have,

A=10;

&A=100;

*&A-->*100-->10 thus, *&A=10
